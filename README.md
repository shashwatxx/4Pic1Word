Flutter Development Task.
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. 'Til your good is better and your better is best.

A clone of 4 Pics 1 Word by lotum.
API for questions: http://3.6.119.41:5000/quiz/questions/
Use ‘answer’, ‘rating’ and ‘options’ fields only as of now
Features to retain:
The application design (UI) can be the same.
‘Play’ to let the user solve all questions. Sorted according to rating from api.
Settings for button sounds and notifications
In multiplayer => “Play a friend”
Play Ludo, the multiplayer functionality should be like that with our game i.e. 4pics1word
A user may create a room and any numbers of players may join. The user who has created the room will share the room code with his friends. And his/her friends will join the room by entering the code.
The user may also choose a category and mode i.e. easy, medium or hard before creating a room.

You don’t have to complete the project compulsorily. You just have to do what you can and how you can challenge yourself to do learn new things and do better.
Submit your deliverables before the deadline, even if they aren’t completed. Your consistency in git commits is one of the judgement criteria.
Deliverables:
Send the built apk via mail to kdpisda@codevector.in.
Host the code on github (private repository), and add ‘werainkhatri’ user as a collaborator.
You’ll be judged on the following: 
Smooth bugless working (Most important)
Consistency in git commits.
Simplicity 
Code Structure 
Documentation (Less important)
Bonus Task:
Play with a random player (as in League in 4Pics1Word)
Leaderboard
Saving progress of users
Knowing is not enough; we must apply. Willing is not enough; we must do.
If you feel overwhelmed by the project to be delivered within such a short time, it’s fine. You don’t have to complete everything that is mentioned here. Just give yourself a try to learn new things and a lot you can do when you’re out of your comfort zone.
